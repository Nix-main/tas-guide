#### The part where she introduces you.
A Tool-Assisted-Speedrun (TAS) is a type of speedrun which uses external tools to improve completion time. Other acronyms found in this documentation include "TASed", "TASer", "TASes", and "TASing".

They are often not recorded on any leaderboard and are used to test the limits of a given speedrunning category, test tricks that may be difficult or impossible for humans, demonstrate without a focus on optimization (LOTAD - Low Optimization Tool Assisted Demonstration), or made for fun.
Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong TASes are made using a Linux application called libTAS. libTAS is capable of providing frame-by-frame advancing, pausing, fast forward, savestates, and other important tools for most games that can run natively on Linux, which includes both Hollow Knights.
Extra steps must often be taken to keep these two games...somewhere in the realm of determinism, as will be explained in future pages.
